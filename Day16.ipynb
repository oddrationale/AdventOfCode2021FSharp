    "<p>As you leave the cave and reach open waters, you receive a transmission from the Elves back on the ship.</p>\n",
    "<p>The transmission was sent using the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (<span title=\"Just be glad it wasn't sent using the BuoyancY Transmission Encoding System.\">BITS</span>), a method of packing numeric expressions into a binary sequence. Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal\" target=\"_blank\">hexadecimal</a> (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>The first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>0 = 0000\n",
    "1 = 0001\n",
    "2 = 0010\n",
    "3 = 0011\n",
    "4 = 0100\n",
    "5 = 0101\n",
    "6 = 0110\n",
    "7 = 0111\n",
    "8 = 1000\n",
    "9 = 1001\n",

    "<p>The BITS transmission contains a single <em>packet</em> at its outermost layer which itself contains many other packets. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra <code>0</code> bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.</p>\n",
    "<p>Every packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet <em>version</em>, and the next three bits encode the packet <em>type ID</em>. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence <code>100</code> represents the number <code>4</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Packets with type ID <code>4</code> represent a <em>literal value</em>. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a <code>1</code> bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a <code>0</code> bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string <code>D2FE28</code> becomes:</p>\n",

    "<li>The three bits labeled <code>T</code> (<code>100</code>) are the packet type ID, <code>4</code>, which means the packet is a literal value.</li>\n",
    "<li>The five bits labeled <code>A</code> (<code>10111</code>) start with a <code>1</code> (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, <code>0111</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The five bits labeled <code>B</code> (<code>11110</code>) start with a <code>1</code> (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, <code>1110</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The five bits labeled <code>C</code> (<code>00101</code>) start with a <code>0</code> (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, <code>0101</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>The three unlabeled <code>0</code> bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>So, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation <code>011111100101</code>, which is <code>2021</code> in decimal.</p>\n",
    "<p>Every other type of packet (any packet with a type ID other than <code>4</code>) represent an <em>operator</em> that performs some calculation on one or more sub-packets contained within. Right now, the specific operations aren't important; focus on parsing the hierarchy of sub-packets.</p>\n",
    "<p>An operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the <em>length type ID</em>:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If the length type ID is <code>0</code>, then the next <em>15</em> bits are a number that represents the <em>total length in bits</em> of the sub-packets contained by this packet.</li>\n",

    "<p>Finally, after the length type ID bit and the 15-bit or 11-bit field, the sub-packets appear.</p>\n",
